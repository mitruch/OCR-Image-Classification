Comparison of machine learning algorithms in classification of image segments

This project presents the classification of image segments problem and ways to find best of classifiers using machine learning algorithms like k nearest neighbors, support vector machine and artificial neural networks. Implementation is based on the Python scikit-learn library. Results of algorithms performance has been veryfied by using MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) and EMNIST (Extended MNIST) digits database.
